🔐 Military-Grade Security: AES-256-CBC encryption ensures enterprise-level data protection
💰 Accessible Pricing: $9.9/month subscription (compared to $100+/month enterprise alternatives)  
🌍 Global Reach: Support for 5 languages (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish)
⚡ Enterprise Scale: Optimized performance for codebases with 100,000+ lines
🖥️ Cross-Platform: Native desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux
